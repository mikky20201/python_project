Updates the title, amount, and updated_at timestamp whenever a change is made to the expense.

to_dict(self)
Returns a dictionary representation of the expense.

## ExpenseDatabase Class

-__init__(self)
-add_expense(self, title, amount)
-remove_expense(self, expense_id)
-get_expense_by_id(self, expense_id)
-get_expense_by_title(self, title)
-to_dict(self)

# The ExpenseDatabase class manages a collection of expenses with the following methods:

__init__(self)
Initializes an empty database.

add_expense(self, title, amount)
Adds a new expense to the database.

remove_expense(self, expense_id)
Removes an expense from the database using the expense ID.

get_expense_by_id(self, expense_id)
Filters and retrieves an expense with the specified expense ID.

get_expense_by_title(self, title)
Filters and retrieves expenses with the specified title.

to_dict(self)
Returns a list of dictionaries, each representing an expense in the database.
